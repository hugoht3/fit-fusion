# Main Goal of the Website
> To Those who have a curiosity on how many calories they spent in a day. know exactaly how much it is. And a little hint regarding a increase or decrease in their weight

# Testing 

This JavaScript code facilitates the calculation of Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) for individuals based on their age, height, weight, and gender.
> The first function to be called is calculateBmr() that serve as a selector for two diferent calculations.
> Two separate functions, calculateBmrMale() and calculateBmrFemale(), compute the BMR using specific formulas tailored to each gender.
> The BMR represents the number of calories the body burns at rest.
 Additionally, the goalMessage() function provides insights into how many hours of various physical activities, such as running, basketball, volleyball, football, and cycling, would be needed to burn the calculated calories.
 Furthermore, the loseWeight() and gainWeight() functions offer personalized tips for either losing or gaining weight based on the calculated BMR and the selected gender.
> Users are required to input their height, weight, and age, and the code ensures these inputs meet certain criteria before performing the calculations.
